# Challenge 1: Refactoring

## Description

In this assignment, I took the exsisting code of the Horiseon landing page and refactored it. The purpose of this was to update the old code to make the webpage more accesible to users, as well as orgnaize the code better for other developers. Replacing the previous HTML tags with semantic tags and consolidating and organizing the CSS to follow semantic structure allows for better readability for other developers. Giving the HTML code a more semantic structure, adding a name in the 'title' element, and providing each image with an 'alt' attribute allows for more accessibility to those who use screen readers. Completing this challenge taught me the importance of writing code with intention; every section of code serves a purpose for both users and developers, so it is important that your code is clear and purposeful.


## Usage

The Horiseon landing page provides links to each of their services as well as a short discription of each.
